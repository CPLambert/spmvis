# **SPM Data Visualisation Toolbox**

This essentially forms a wrapper for some nice techniques to visualise different forms of data (that are normally a bit of a pain to use). At the moment I have only added different types of raincloud (scatter-density) plots, but I will be adding more in due course. 

Works as an SPM toolbox extension so needs adding to spm/toolbox in your SPM download. Will only work with SPM12 or later. I have only tested on MATLAB 2019b and later.
